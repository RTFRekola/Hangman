# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

This consists of getting the Git and GitHub going. 

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game

This consists of setting up a word list (as a list), choosing a word from the list (using random.choice), and asking a user to select a letter (with input). Once the user has selected a letter, it is tested (in a if statement) for validity (i.e. that it is an alphabetical letter and just one character). The input is tested with isalpha() method and len.
